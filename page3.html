        <div class="container">
        <h1>Types of CSS</h1>
        <h2>Inline</h2>
            <p>Inline CSS is when the <b>style</b> attribute is directly included in a HTML tag. This method is great to implement when the CSS only has only one or two properties and is permanent. However, this method has a downside because it has a lack of flexibility when the developer wants to change the design. Look at the following example: </p>
            <div class="center">
            <img src="inline%20css.JPG">
            </div>
            <br>
        <h2>Internal</h2>
            <p>Internal CSS is when the tag &lt;style&gt; ... &lt;/style&gt; is written within the &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; tag. This method is good to use when the css script is only used for 1 HTML file. However, it has its downsides, where the css script could not be used to configure other HTML files.</p>
            <div class="center">
            <img src="internalcss.JPG">
            </div>
            <br>
        <h2>External</h2>
            <p>External CSS is a CSS writing style, where the CSS script is kept on a separate file with the .css file extension. To link the HTML and CSS file, the CSS file is included in the element within the &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;. On the HTML file. For example:</p>
            <div class="center">
            <img src="externalcss1.JPG">
            </div>
            <p>The external CSS method is the most recommended method as it has many advantages, such as, it can be used by many HTML files which can make a template for the website, and it is more flexible in the case of changing the design.</p>

<!----------Selector-------->
<section id="selector">
    <div class="container">
    <h1>Selector</h1>
<p>Selector is the term used to select a certain HTML element which will be modified using CSS. In general, there are three types of selectors in CSS, which are class selector, id selector and tag selector.
</p>
<h3>Tag Selector</h3>
 <p>Tag selector is a selector which directly uses the HTML tag name that want to be altered or modified by CSS. However in this case the HTML tag does not use the &lt; &gt; sign</p>
<h3>Selector Class</h3>
<p>Selector class is a selector which uses a class name used in a tag that wants to be configured by CSS. However the class name is accompanied by a (.), placed before the name. This selector’s function is more specific than the tag selector.
</p>
<h3>Id Selector</h3>
<p>Selector id is a selector form which uses the id name from an HTML element which wants to be modified by CSS. In this case, the id name is accompanied by a hashtag (#) before the id name. However this selector can only be used for one HTML element, which makes this selector more specific than the other two.
</p>

    </div>
    </section>
    
    <section id="elements">
        <div class="container">
        <h1>Property and Value</h1>
<p><b>Property</b> is the characteristics or rules  that is given to an HTML element such as, color, background, font and so-on. In writing specific properties, there will be <b>Value</b>, which creates the value of a property. Property is a selector which is placed between the ( and ) sign. Property and value are separated by a colon (:) and ended with a “;” sign. Every value of a property is different, there are some with values in form of numbers and some in values that are available for a certain property.
<br>
Almost all property in CSS has a derivative, for example, the property background has a derivative of background-image, background-repeat, background-position and etc.
</p>

<h3>CSS Shorthand</h3>
        <p>>As explained before, most properties have a derivative, such as, padding which has a derivative of padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left. CSS has a feature called CSS-shorthand which is a feature that allows developers to combine several values from different derivatives which is derived from the same property. The method is to use the original property and each values which then those values will be arranged with the arrangement that is already determined.
        <br>
        For example, if there is a property like so:
            </p>
            <div class="center">
            <img src="CSSshorthand.JPG">
            </div>
        <p>The CSS can be simplified with the padding property, with the value arranged starting from the clockwise direction, which is, padding-top. Shown in the picture below:</p>
            <div class="center">
            <img src="CSSshorthand1.JPG">
            </div>
        <p>The script shown in the picture above can even be more simplified which is by combining top and bottom, and right and left, with the circumstance that both the top and bottom, and right and left have the same value for each pair. For example:</p>
        <div class="center">
        <img src="CSSshorthand2.JPG">
            </div>
        <p>However, if all four have the same value, therefore, the script could be written using only one value. For example, if all values are 30px, then it would be like so:</p>
            <div class="center">
            <img src="CSSshorthand3.JPG">
            </div>
        </div>
    
    </section>
    <section>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Absolute Units</h1>
        <p>Absolute units are units with a fixed size , unchanged and unaffected by any elements. Absolute units include, cm (centimeter), mm (millimeter), in (inch), px (pixel), pt (point), and pc (pica). The ratio between each units are:
<br>
1in = 96 px = 2,54cm
<br>
1px = 1/96in
<br>
1pt = 1/72in
<br>
1pc = 12pt

</p>
        
        </div>
    
    </section>
    <section id="elements">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Property CSS</h1>
        <h3>Box Model</h3>
        <p>Box model is a concept where every element on every webpage is considered as a box. This box will then build the layout and design structure of a website. This concept is very much attached to every element in HTML.</p>
        <h3>Height and Width</h3>
        <p>The height property determines the height of the box, whereas the width property determines the width of the box. If a background is given a &lt;div&gt; tag with CSS, normally it wouldn’t show up if the width and height is not determined yet. The value from this property is in the form of numbers with the units being px or %.
<br>
There are other properties which are related to width and height, such as:
<br>
<b>Max-width</b>, to configure the width which adjusts the content but not over the determined border
<br>
<b>Max-height</b>, to configure the height to adjust the content but not over the determined border
<br>
<b>Min-height</b>, to configure the height to adjust the content but not less than the determined border
<br>
<b>Min-width</b>, to configure the width to adjust the content but not less than the determined border</p>
        <h3>Margin and Padding</h3>
        <p>The margin property configures the distance of the box from the elements around it or the wrapping elements of the box (container). Whereas, the padding adjusts the distance between the box and the contents which is within the box. The margin property have several derivatives, such as margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left. As for padding its derivatives consist of, padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left. The four derivatives of both padding and margin can be simplified to the <b>margin [top] [right] [bottom] [left]</b> and <b>padding [top] [right] [bottom] [left]. </b>The values of both properties are in the form of numbers with a general unit which is px. The other values that can be given are inherit and auto. If it is auto, the browser will create all values having the same values on each side, therefore creating an equal box.</p>
        
    <h3>Border and Outline</h3>
        <p>The border property creates a frame for the box. The border property have derivatives that are divided into two. The first part shows the border sides which consist of, border-top, border-right, border-bottom and border-left. The second part configures the style of the border, it consist of, border-width, border-style and border-color. Both parts can be combined into: border-top-style, border-left-style, border-top-color, border-left-color, border-top-size and etc. If the first derivative type is combined, the arrangement is the same as margin and padding.
<br>
There is a similar property to border, which is outline, the derivative and configuration of the property usage is the same as border, including the inputted property values. The difference is that outline is not an element, which means it does not affect the size of the box. In some cases, outline may cover the other contents. The outline property has one derivative that the border property does not, which is, <b>outline-offset</b>. Outline offset is the derivative which configures the distance between the outline and the box elements.</p>
